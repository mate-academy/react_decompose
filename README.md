# React Decompose

Split the `App.js` into components based on CSS blocks. CSS code should be split too.

- You already have `Article`, `Header` and `Welcome` folders inside `./src/components/` with required files.
- You may also create a folder for the `Navigation` component and move navigation there.
- Tests expect you to use `export default` for all the components.

## Instructions

- Install Prettier Extention and use this [VSCode settings](https://mate-academy.github.io/fe-program/tools/vscode/settings.json) to enable format on save.
- Implement a solution following the [React task guideline](https://github.com/mate-academy/react_task-guideline#react-tasks-guideline)
- Open one more terminal and run tests with `npm test` to ensure your solutions is correct
- Replace `<your_account>` with your Github username in the [DEMO LINK](https://<your_account>.github.io/react_decompose/) and add it to the PR description
