1. [CODE STYLE] - Don't overuse empty lines between components.

BAD EXAMPLE:
```
<A />


<B />



<C />
```

GOOD EXAMPLE:
```
<A />
<B />
<C />
```

2. [PROJECT STRUCTURE] - create separate folder per component, where you could put all files(styles, components, and so on)
3. [GIT KNOWLEDGE] - check if you added ALL your files to git.
